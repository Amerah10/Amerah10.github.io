<h2> The Happiest Girl </h2>
<h3> By: BLACKPINK </h3>

<h4> <p style="font-family:courier;">  Don't hold my hand, don't beg me back <br> 
  Don't say that we'll make it through this <br>
If i'm so beautiful then, why? </p> </h4>

<h4> <p style="font-family:courier;"> The doors we slammed <br>
The plates we smashed <br>
Echo with the sound of madness <br>
I can't remember why we try <br> </p>
</h4>

<h4> <p style="font-family:courier;"> My heart only wants you <br>
	The moment you say no </p>
</h4>

<h3> [Chorus] </h3>


<h4> <p style="font-family:courier;"> But tonight, i'll be the happiest girl in the world <br>
You'll see like it doesn't matter <br>
Tonight, i'll be the happiest girl in the world <br>
You'll see like it never happened </p></h4>

<h4> <p style="font-family:courier;"> I can stop the tears if I want to <br>
	I can stop the tears if I want to <br>
I can stop the tears if I want to </p> <br> </h4>

<h4> <p style="font-family:courier;">But tonight, i'll be the happiest girl <br>
	You'll see that it never happened </p></h4>

<h4> <p style="font-family:courier;">Don't make us saints <br>
	We're wards of pain <br>
The past and perfect picture <br>
There's no else to blame this time </p> <br>
</h4>

<h4> <p style="font-family:courier;"> Don't change the truth <br>
	We can't undo the high, we chase steal the crash, no <br>
You'tr not the one, who gets to cry </p> </h4>

<h4> <p style="font-family:courier;"> My heart only wants you <br>
	The moment you say no </p></h4>

<h3> [Chorus]</h3>

<h4> <p style="font-family:courier;">But tonight, i'll be the happiest girl in the world <br>
You'll see like it doesn't matter <br>
Tonight, i'll be the happiest girl in the world <br>
You'll see like it never happened </p></h4>

<h4> <p style="font-family:courier;"> I can stop the tears if I want to <br>
	I can stop the tears if I want to <br>
I can stop the tears if I want to </p> </h4>

<h4> <p style="font-family:courier;"> But tonight, i'll be the happiest girl <br>
	You'll see that it never happened </p> </h4>

<h4> <p style="font-family:courier;"> All it takes is a smooth pop of a bottle top to fix a heart <br>
	A broken heart, baby <br>

All it takes is a little rolling paper take us to the start <br>
Go back to start </p> </h4>

<h4> <p style="font-family:courier;"> But tonight, i'll be the happiest girl in the world <br>
You'll see like it doesn't matter <br>
Tonight, i'll be the happiest girl in the world <br>
You'll see like it never happened </p></h4>

<h4> <p style="font-family:courier;"> I can stop the tears if I want to <br>
	I can stop the tears if I want to <br>
I can stop the tears if I want to </p> </h4>

<h4> <p style="font-family:courier;">But tonight, i'll be the happiest girl <br>
	You'll see that it never happened </p></h4>
